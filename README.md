# COVID_NLP_Analysis
The data within our analysis was collated using a Python Script and the Twitter API. API requests were run on a daily basis over the period of a July 2020, and aimed to collect information around tweets containing the #covid19 hashtag.

Our analysis is based around utilising a naive bayesian classifier to identify whether individuals are verified users or not. Although, this is still a work in progress as it stands.
