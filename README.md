# COVID_NLP_Analysis
The data within our analysis was collated using a Python Script that called the Twitter API. API requests were run on a daily basis over a period of a number of months, beginning in July 2020, relating to tweets containing the #covid19 hashtag.

Our analysis is based around utilising a naive bayesian classifier, to identify whether individuals are verified users or not based on the content of their tweets. Although, this is still a work in progress as it stands.
